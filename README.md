Make sure your Sketch App is updated to the **LATEST** version.

Copy and paste the following commands into `Terminal` then press `Return` to run.


#### If you are using non-AppStore Version (Downloaded from official website):

killall Sketch ; cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/ && [ -f "assets-v78.sketchpreset" ] && mv assets-v78.sketchpreset assets-v78.sketchpreset.backup && curl -O https://cdn.rawgit.com/RayPS/my-sketch-colors/master/assets-v78.sketchpreset && open /Applications/Sketch.app ; echo 'All Done!!!'
